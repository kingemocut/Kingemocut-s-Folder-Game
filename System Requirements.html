<h1>The Rules.</h1><br><br>
Now this may have a lot of NO's but thats because if you do these things, your gonna be taking the fun away, sunny. <br>
DON'T:<br>
Use RUN (On windows XP SP3) or the search bar (On windows 7 SP1) <br>
<br>
Make all the hint's too hard for the player you want to play. sometimes this may force you to make it stupidly simple, but this is to let them have fun.<br>
<br>
Say you made all of this game. just because you got the ALPHA/BETA vesion under GNU, you do not own it. The Final vesion of this Will be pay-for release. Even moreso because the images took a LOT of time and a LOT of REAL MONEY to make and/or get copyright holders permision. respect the simple laws of copyright please. <br>
<br>
DO:<br>
Enjoy Modding this game(more info about modification as of ver. 0.0.2Î±)<br>

<br>
Send any alpha/beta Problems to<a id="E-Mail" href="mailto://kingemocut@yahoo.co.uk" title="My Main E-Mail"> kingemocut@yahoo.co.uk</a><br>
<br>

<br>
but mostly...<br>

<!--Some small thanks
<copyright id="Full">
Thanks to In Easy Steps for help with learning to program in JS and HTML 5.0, as well as a little help with CSS. Without you guys/gals these html documents would be VERY Bland.
Thanks to xXx8Cyantrain8xXx for being the cutest most suportive girlfriend a guy could ever wish for. Without your suport this game wouldn't even have been thought of, so i owe you big time <3
Thanks to you, Player/Downloader, for playing this game. without you helping to play this game, all of our (xXx8CyanTrain8xXx's and Kingemocut's) work would have been in vain.
Thanks also to Breaking Benjamin, the people who do the song that loads upon site loading. thanks.
For all other thanks, you know where to go.
