Simple HTML 5.0 tutorial
by Kingemocut

all commands must be ended with a </[command name]> tag after where [command name] is the name of the command.
e.g. a command block with the tag <title> must have an ending with the term </title>
<title> command creates the page's title
<script> creates a script, and using src="[script location]" attribute will allow the user to embed a external script.
geniral syntax for <script> is <script type="text/[programming language name]" src="[script location]">

<link rel="stylesheet"> Obtains the infomation of the CSS in the Href Block



 <br> creates line break, also known as new line/paragraph.

<p> Creates a new paragraph of text, and is a smarter choice, but i personally prefer to only use <br> -->
<title>Edit Log</title>
<!-- Scripts -->
<script type="text/javascript">
function Popup()
{
var winObject = window.open( "./The 'Gifts'/Misc HTMLs (unnecessary to open)/Name Popup.html", "windowName", "top=200, left=100, width=700, height=200, status");
}
</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Question 1 stylesheet.css">

<!--Autoplay in IE, Google Chrome, & Safari - not in Firefox or Opera-->
<!--<audio src="" autoplay>[ Fallback Message ]</audio>-->
   
<!-- This would autoplay in Firefox, Google Chrome, & Opera - but not in IE or Safari -->
<!--<audio src="audio.ogg" autoplay>Fallback Message</audio>-->

<!-- <!-- please remember to delete the <!-- tags and endings! -->
